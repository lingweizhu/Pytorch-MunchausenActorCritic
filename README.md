# Munchausen Actor Critic using PyTorch
The code was adapted from [Toshiki Watanabe](https://github.com/ku2482/sac-discrete.pytorch), please check the original page for update and credit.

The base algorithm is SAC discrete [1] for my own research purpose, might add the continuous version later.


## Munchausen Reinforcement Learning [2]
The original paper introduces Munchausen trick only on top of DQN, here I try to extend it to actor critic style, this requires exploration on the suitable policy loss.
